## Overview
### Request: complete one simple database in two months(specific requests are written in .ppt)

###### This is the last course project(SE102) when I was in the School of Software in SJTU

###### SE102 isÂ one practical course(with no lessons) and students are requested to complete one database during the summer.

###### Later I go to Department of Computer Science in SJTU

#### Key Point:

- B+/B Tree index
- Two level Cache with LRU
- Recovery Mechanism
- Multithread Optimization for Query

I have already attached my presentation file(.pdf & .ppt), and these files are more detailed
